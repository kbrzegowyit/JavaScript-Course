# Data types: Array methods

This article is about array methods in JavaScript.

## Splice
It is a swiss army knife for arrays. It can do everything: **insert**, **remove** and **replace** items.

`arr.splice(start[, deleteCount, elem1, ..., elemN])`

*start* - index from we start.

*deleteCound* - number of elements to remove.

*item1,...,itemN* - new items that will be inserted at *start* position.

It returns the deleted items.

## Slice
It copies elements of an array.

`arr.slice([start], [end])`

It returns a copy of the array starting from *start* and ending at *end* (not including *end*). The arguments can be negative, in that case position from array end is assumed.

We can use the method without the arguments, then it returns a copy of the array.

## Concat
The method returns a new array that includes values from other arrays and additional items.

`arr.concat(arg1, arg2...)`

If an argument *argN* is an array, then all its elements are copied. Otherwise, the argument itself is copied.

- array and primitivs â†’ copied by value.
- objects â†’ copied by reference.

## Iterate: forEach
The method allows to run a function for every element of the array.

`arr.forEach(function(item, index, array) {
  // ... do something with item
});`

## Searching
### indexOf, lastIndexOf, includes
They work the same way as for strings. `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf` use strict equality.

ðŸš©`includes` in comparison to `indexOf` correctly handles `NaN`.

```javascript
const arr = [NaN];
alert( arr.indexOf(NaN) ); // -1 (wrong, should be 0)
alert( arr.includes(NaN) );// true (correct)
```

### find, findIndex, findLastIndex
The following methods are perfect in the case of working with arrays of objects.

`find(callbackFn)`

The function is called for elements of the array, one after another:

- *item* is the element.
- *index* is its index.
- *array* is the array itself.

If it returns `true`, the search is stopped, **the item is returned**. If nothing found, `undefined` is returned.

`findIndex(callbackFn)`

The method has the same syntax, but returns the *index* where the element was found instead of the element itself. The value of -1 is returned if nothing is found.

`findLastIndex(callbackFn)`

The arr.findLastIndex method is like `findIndex`, but searches from right to left, similar to `lastIndexOf`.

`filter(callbackFn)`

The method is similar to `find` but returns an array of all matching elements.

## Transforming
### map, sort, reverse, split, join, reduce, reduceRight
There are methods that transform and reorder an array.

`map(callbackFn)` 

It calls the function for each element of the array and returns the array of results.

```javascript
let result = arr.map(function(item, index, array) {
  // returns the new value instead of item
});
```

`sort(compareFn)`

The call to method sorts the array in place, changing its element order.

**The items are sorted as strings by default.**

`reverse()`

The method method reverses the order of elements in arr in place.

`split(delim)`

It splits the string into an array by the given delimiter delim.

`join(glue)`

It creates a string of arr items joined by glue between them.

`reduce()/reduceRight()`

The methods calculate a single value based on the array.

The method arr.reduceRight does the same, but goes from right to left.

```javascript
let value = arr.reduce(function(accumulator, item, index, array) {
  // ...
}, [initial]);
```

## isArray
Arrays are based on objects, so `typeof` doesn't help us to distinguish plain object from an array.

```javascript
alert(typeof {}); // object
alert(typeof []); // object (same)
```

Instead of that we need to use a special method for that: `Array.isArray(value)`.

```javascript
alert(Array.isArray({})); // false

alert(Array.isArray([])); // true
```
